5.Find the output and write explanation? 
Ans:class Main 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int t;
		System.out.println("Value of variable t:"+t);
	}
}

output:
Error-  Because compile time error local variable do not declare.
 Variables created inside a function definition are local,
 you can’t access a local variable from outside its home function. 
 That means you are free to have multiple variables with the same 
 name as long as they are not in the same function.
