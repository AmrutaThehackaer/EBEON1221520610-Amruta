6.Find the output and write explanation? 
Ans:class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{  
		byte b = 127;
		++b;
		b++;
		System.out.println("Value of variable b:"+b);
	}
}

output:
Value of variable b:-127
  Type casting a larger variable into a smaller variable results in modulo of larger variable by range of smaller variable.
  The range() method in the IntStream class in Java is used to return a sequential ordered IntStream from startInclusive to
  endExclusive by an incremental step of 1. This includes the startInclusive as well minmnum number.
