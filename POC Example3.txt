3. Initialize On  Object Creation 
i. Create a class Car which contains wheels and model as Instance variables. 
ii. Initialize the number of wheels of the car at the time of creating the 
Object of the car and assign the model of the car to the model variable and
print the model after creating the object of the car class
(not at the time of creating the object).  
Ans:public class car{
  int Wheels;
  String Model;

public car(int Wheels,String Model)
	{
	    this.Wheels = Wheels;
		this.Model = Model;
	}
	public static void main(String []args) 
	{
		car s = new car(5,"Honda");
		car s1 = new car(4,"suzuki");
		System.out.println(s.Wheels);
		System.out.println(s.Model);
		System.out.println(s1.Wheels);
		System.out.println(s1.Model);
	}

}

output:
5
Honda
4
suzuki
